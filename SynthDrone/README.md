# SynthDrone Dataset
SynthDrone is a multi-source dataset generated by the Synthetic Drone Synthetic Drone Monitoring Framework.
![SynthDrone](../img/SynthDrone.png)
It is collected with 50 locations, 300 video clips, 18,000 frames and 2,171,133 entities. Each frame contains a 1920x1080 scene images and corresponding segmentation map, depth map, location, bounding box and id information for each entity.

### ann
Json files with following structure:
```
{"Frame ID":{"Ped":[Ped1, Ped2...], "Veh":[Veh1, Veh2...]}}
```
The Ped instance follows following structure:
```
["ID", [id, loc, isInVeh, isVis, isOcc, groInd, isOnScr, vehIsOn, leftP, rightP, rearP, frontP, Note]]
```
The Veh instance follows following structure:
```
["ID", [id, loc, isVis, isOcc, isOnScr, cla, disNam, locName, claDisName, claLocName, leftP, rightP, rearP, frontP]]
```
### dep
Depth information saved with numpy files(.npy).

### img
Jpeg images.
### inf
Scene information for each video clip, includes collection location, time, weather, height *et al*.
### seg
Segmentation Map for all concerned entities (Ped and Veh).
